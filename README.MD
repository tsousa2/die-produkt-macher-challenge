## Architeture

In order to fullfill the requirements the stack I decided to use was the following. Some of the choices were made based on the time to fullfill the challenge, but also due to myself feeling comfortable with these frameworks / programming languages.

## Frontend

- Angular
  - This choice was made due to it providing a fast way to provide Single Page Applications

## Backend

- NestJS
  - I chose this framework, due to the support it provides for multiple functionalities. It allows the implementation of functionalities in an easy way due to having built-in libraries to do so, allowing myself to develop the API in an efficient and scalable way.
  - As shown the in the implementation, I was able to provide an endpoint with file support and input sanitization, by simply importing some of it's built-in libraries.

## Notes / Improvements

Due to the challenge being limitted in time some functionality wasn't implemented such as:
- Connection between Frontend and Backend
- Unit and E2E Tests for every piece of the code. (Covers some partially).

These 2 points, would've been my main focus, if more time could have been invested.
